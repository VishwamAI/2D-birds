# 2D-birds Project

## Project Overview
The 2D-birds project is an innovative simulation that models bird behavior in a two-dimensional space. It utilizes reinforcement learning to teach virtual birds how to navigate their environment and interact with various elements within it.

## Features
- **How to Stand**: Simulates the bird's ability to perch and balance on different surfaces.
- **How to Move Head**: Models the bird's head movements for looking around and interacting with the environment.

## Datasets
The project includes datasets that capture the birds' standing and head movement behaviors, which have been split into smaller chunks for ease of use:
- small_chunk_aa.csv
- small_chunk_ab.csv
- small_chunk_ac.csv

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the project will be provided here.

## Usage
Details on how to run simulations and utilize the project's features will be included here.
